# Money talks, but you think

I walked along the street of Bandar Baru Bangi on Saturday evening. I walked past shoplots offering beautiful dresses, delicious food and other products. I stopped at a computer shop and picked up a mouse. It is an attractive wireless mouse with RGB led decorated around the mouse with CPI level up to 4000. For a geeky guy like me it has a lot to offer. I can play game better, do work in more precise way and also look good while doing that. On top of all that sweet offering, the mouse come with mousepad too! The total package costs MYR129.00.

# Ninja-Precision Thinking

When I set foot out of my house that morning I don't plan to buy a mouse. I don't plan to buy a mouse because I don't need a mouse right now. Seems easy, right? No it is not that easy, we all have been through it. You started to think, then you starts to overthink. 

When I set foot out, I planned for something simple, something that fit into my schedule. I don't value money equally to time, but they almost as valuable.

# Money is time and time is money.

Money is time and time is money. They might not be able to substitute each other but they go together. 


The mouse can wait for another day. 

## Money talks louder than words

At the time of writing I am working at one of those Mega Mall in Kuala Lumpur. I always see people at the mall at any given time. early in the morning, noon up till midnight. Do these people has purchasing power?
