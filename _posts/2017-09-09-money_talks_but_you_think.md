# You think, but money talks

At the time of writing I am working at one of those Mega Mall in Kuala Lumpur. I always see people at the mall at any given time. early in the morning, noon up till midnight. Do these people has purchasing power? I don't know to be honest. But you wake up in the morning what was your goal on that day? You decided to go to the mall. What would you do? You want to go window shopping. That is the initial intention. But you are at the mall, you started to spend. The moment you realize, you already spent three pieces of 50 Ringgit notes. Maybe you want to have lunch at the mall, you decided to buy the book you saw, you decided to fix your hair. Even though you don't puchase a merchandize. You still spend. You went home happy. Money talks.

# Money talks, but you think

I walked along the street of Bandar Baru Bangi on Saturday evening. I walked past shoplots offering beautiful dresses, delicious food and other products. I stopped at a computer shop and picked up a mouse. It is an attractive wireless mouse with RGB led decorated around the mouse with CPI level up to 4000. For a geeky guy like me it has a lot to offer. I can play game better, do work in more precise way and also look good while doing that. On top of all that sweet offering, the mouse come with mousepad too! The total package costs MYR129.00.

# You think, for you

When I set foot out of my house that morning I don't plan to buy a mouse. 

The mouse can wait for another day. 

I can go through the next few days without a new mouse. I keep some money aside to reward myself. when the time comes, I will use the money and get the mouse for myself as a reward. It will be more meaningful, I will get happier to use a mouse that means something to me.
