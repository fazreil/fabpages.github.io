# Money talks, but you think

I walked along the street of Bandar Baru Bangi on Saturday evening. I walked past shoplots offering beautiful dresses, delicious food and other products. I stopped at a computer shop and picked up a mouse. It is an attractive wireless mouse with RGB led decorated around the mouse with CPI level up to 4000. For a geeky guy like me it has a lot to offer. I can play game better, do work in more precise way and also look good while doing that. On top of all that sweet offering, the mouse come with mousepad too! The total package costs MYR129.00.

When I set foot out of my house that morning I don't plan to buy a mouse. 


The mouse can wait for another day. 

## Money talks louder than words

At the time of writing I am working at one of those Mega Mall in Kuala Lumpur. I always see people at the mall at any given time. early in the morning, noon up till midnight. Do these people has purchasing power?
