# 23:59:59.999 

I live by one mantra and one mantra only:

Even legends are given 24 hours a day.

True enough, casio never created a watch that ticks beyond 23:59:59.999 nor any brand of watch known to man. This is simply because we only have 24 hours a day not a miliseconds more (but we may have less). 

# Life Goals

What makes each of us accomplish more than others is how we organize our time to slot in activities. Today I woke up and I decide to perform a git push to this blog. I must find a slot in my day to sit down to do that. I believe setting short term goal will give yourself a challenge. By completing that challenge you can enjoy a sense of accomplishment. Small accomplishment but it actually do a lot for you. You're teaching yourself to become descipline with your time management. It also teach you to keep your promise.

# Time Management

Time and tide waits for no man

Time dont wait for you, so you need to organize your day way ahead of time. You need to plan today yesterday or the day before. You need to plan tomorrow today or yesterday.

# Keeping promises

What a man if he don't keep his promises
